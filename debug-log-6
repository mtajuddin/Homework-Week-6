//What is the function to set the parameters of the canvas again?
//size(width, height);

//When I run the program no circles are visible, even though I have if statements...
//Oh! I forgot to add ellipse functions to the draw function

//How do I make sure the ball stops when it approaches the edge of the canvas?
//I need to reverse its position. I need to create a while loop.
//Well, actually I don't need a while loop since the draw function runs continuously.
//An if statement will suffice. I can multiply the value of the incrementing x and y variables by negative one.
//This makes every value get subtracted by a negative value.

//When I change the number of xSpeed and ySpeed from -1 to a larger number the ellipses go faster until they are invisible.
//I need to change the variable of xSpeed2 and ySpeed2 to get the ellipses to move independently of one another.
